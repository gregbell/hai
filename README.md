# hai

Meet **hai**, a tiny CLI tool that turns natural language into shell commands.
You describe what you want to do, hai suggests a command, and asks if you'd like
to run it. A simple, unix-y tool that does one thing /really/ well.

```console
$ hai "use pandoc to convert all the markdown files in this directory to an ebook"
Command: pandoc -f markdown -t epub -o book.epub *.md
âœ” Looks good?
```

Just describe what you want:

```console
hai "copy all txt files to the backup directory"
```

Or pipe stuff into it `hai`:

```basconsole
cat some-file | hai
```

Some more examples:

```console
$ hai "find and delete all log files"
Command: find . -name "*.log" -delete
```

```console
$ hai "list all running docker containers"
Command: docker ps
```

```console
$ hai "find all jpg files and resize them to 800px wide"
Command: find . -name "*.jpg" -print0 | xargs -0 mogrify -resize 800x
```

```console
$ hai "search all markdown files for TODO and save the results to todos.txt"
Command: grep -r "TODO" *.md > todos.txt
```
